    Let's Encrypt brought huge changes since it was launched and the adoption rate of HTTPS
    has been incredible. While Let's Encrypt provides free certificates, we decided to provide you a free monitoring
    service so that you never regret the day you secured your website. Just because your certificate expired and made
    your website unavailable.

<p class="tc-onyx">
    The Professional version of KeyChest, and its free cloud service, is a perfect fit for everyone who cares about the
    security of their servers. Still, there are users who need more as their operations are more complex. This requires
    more effort from our side - not only to develop new features, but also to support these users. Security can get
    complicated when used in an environment with a number of
    internal networks, offices, or even internal key management. We work hard to help even these users and so we came up
    with KeyChest Enterprise.

<h3 class="mg-md tc-rich-electric-blue">Clear distinction between Professional and Enterprise</h3>

<p class="tc-onyx">
    We will not compromise on basic features and all users of KeyChest will keep having access to the same depth
    of information detected by KeyChest. We have decided that the distinction between Professional and Enterprise versions
    will be in features, which really are important for larger companies. These are:
</p>

<ul class="tc-onyx">
    <li>User/role management - ability to define departments and users assigned to the departments.</li>
    <li>Internal networks - monitoring of certificates in internal networks (or VLANs) requiring local agents.</li>
    <li>Internal key management - ability to verify certificates issued by internal CAs/PKI systems.</li>
    <li>Integrations - this includes native API as well as particular integrations into change management and communication
    systems.</li>
</ul>

<p class="tc-onyx">
    The following table shows the difference between the Professional version (including the free cloud service at
    <a href="https://keychest.net">https://keychest.net</a> with a fair use policy) and the Enterprise version.
