            This list shows all servers currently being watched. Tests will be run against IP addresses
            resolved directly for the domain names below.

        <p>
            You can add new servers in several different ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>directly in this tab - one server at a time;</li>
            <li>in the "Active Domain" tab - servers can be added automatically when you issue
                the first certificate for them; or
            </li>
            <li>in the "Bulk Import" tab - a quicker entry of servers when you start using KeyChest.</li>
        </ul>
